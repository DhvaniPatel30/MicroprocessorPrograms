CODE SEGMENT
ASSUME CS: CODE, DS:DATA
START: MOV AX, DATA
MOV DS, AX
MOV SI, OFFSET N3 ; Initialized SI as a pointer for variable N3
MOV AX, N1 ; Load AX by N1 variable
MUL N2 ; Multiply N2 variable value by AX
; result as DX (Upper word), AX (lower word)
MOV [SI], AX ; Store result into N3 variable (lower word)
MOV [SI+2], DX ; Store result into N3 variable (upper word)
MOV AX,4C00H
INT 21H
